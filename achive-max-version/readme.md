## Installation

Unfortunately there's a lot to download and set up to get running smoothly. No worries, once you've done this, it should be all good. 

-Max and Max libraries
--Download <a href = "https://cycling74.com/downloads">Max 8</a>. Make sure your license is up-to-date.
--You will need to install the <a href = "https://github.com/Synthesis-ASU-TML/SC">SC repo from Synthesis Center's GitHub</a> (in addition to this one). Follow the instructions on the page to install correctly.

-reacTIVision
--Download this program called <a href = "http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/">reacTIVISION</a> that takes camera feed and looks for markers. Print some markers. Launch it and try it out. After you get it working and calibrated, it's easy to launch. 

-SplitCam or CamTwist 
--You need an app that takes your tabletop or wall video stream and makes it visible to both reacTIVision and Max. These are different on Mac or Windows. 
---For Mac, you want <a href = "http://camtwiststudio.com/">CamTwist</a>. 
---For Windows, you want <a href = "https://splitcam.com/download">SplitCam</a>.
---Make the export of CamTwist or SplitCam the camera you're using to sense markers.

-epochCamera
--if you want to use a cell phone / web phone as a desktop / wall camera device I recommend <a href = "https://www.kinoni.com/support-and-instructions/">EpocCam from Kinoni</a>.

## Setup

Get all that shiz running and follow instructions in Max patches. Download this repo, and open BOTH media-bundler.maxpat and anchor-grabber.maxpat. Ask Garrett questions and he will make many things more CLEAR in this process.
